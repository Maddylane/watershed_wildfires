For the four sites I only used the Grand Lake site for turbidity data and not discharge due to the negative readings. Due to the location of the Grand Lake site the discharge levels at times were reading negatively which is not possible so I chose to not use the discharge data so that it does not affect my observation of the discharge data. The turbidity data was still reliable and that is why I only used that variable from this site when comparing values for my observations. That is why it is seen in Figure 3.8 there is only three sites and why in Figure 3.9 there is four sites.

Observing Figure 3.8 shows that as the increase in burn severity occurs the discharge levels decrease. The control site chosen is found southeast of the East Troublesome bottom fire perimeter in Grandby, CO and is about 20 miles away. The observed discharge in this location is found to have ranging values from 0.05 to 0.15 in/day with a mean value of about 0.09 in/day. Which is observed to be the highest discharge rates compared to all three sites. Then going to the Colorado River site that was in a low burn area the discharge was less than the control site, but greater than the high burn area. The range was from 0.002 to 0.14 in/day, with a mean of 0.07 in/day. Finally, the Troublesome Creek site which is the high burn site had the lowest of the discharge rate. Ranging from 0.0009 to 0.014 in/day with a mean of 0.065 in/day. Observing this data from Figure 3.8 presents a clear finding that the discharge rates in these specific watersheds are negatively affected by the wildfire. Contributing factors that can have an impact on the discharge to decrease it so rapidly is the disturbance to the riparian and upland vegetation condition. When the wildfire burned through the Troublesome Creek watershed it was in a high burn area due to the top of the watershed location. The fire as seen in the image above the part of the fire that the Troublesome Creek is attached to be a high burned soil area. The Higher burn severity then leads to believe that the riparian and upland vegetation was heavily disturbed and burned away. Reduction in riparian woody species cover increases the amount of solar radiation hitting the stream channel, increasing stream temperatures, and accelerating the loss of water in the stream channel to evaporation [@leonard_fire_2017]. The high burn severity and possible loss of the riparian buffer at the head of the Troublesome Creek watershed explains why at the end of the watershed where the gauge is located has such a low discharge rate. Due to the gauge being at the end of the watershed it reads levels after the upstream water begins to evaporate due to the lack of vegetation. There is also the factor to take in that the loss of the organic soil layer which reduces the transfer of soil nutrients into the stream channel which can also alter the levels of base flow discharge in the burned streams. Overall high severity burns on the vegetation and soil in the watershed can cause negative impacts that causes a loss of water in a stream that then decreases discharge rates.


Observing Figure 3.9 shows the rate of turbidity for all four sites from June to October in the year 2021, the year after the fire occurred. Turbidity in streams will be better seen after the fire is out during snow melt and heavy rainfall as well. Since the fire occurred in late fall of 2020 turbidity would not be seen as well until the spring and summer time the following year, which is what Figure 3.9 represents. As seen in the figure the high burn level from Troublesome Creek which is marked as purple produced high turbidity levels and many increased spikes through the wetter seasons for Colorado. The periods of no precipitation, including snow melt, shows the low turbidity concentration. Then when precipitation rates occur turbidity results increased to greater rates due to the area being burned. These high turbidity rate from the high burned area is explained by the lack of infiltration and increase of runoff due to the vegetation being burned away. Then focusing on the other three sites presents how low burn areas and a control site can relate to each other. As seen in Figure 3.9 where the control site is colored green , the turbidity is much lower than the high burn area while it is similar to the low burn area. It is seen that the low burn area does not have a strong effect on turbidity levels as seen by both low burn areas. Where low burn 1 has turbidity levels lower than the control site and low burn 2 had turbidity levels that is not varied far from the values of the control site. The reason the low burn areas may not present high turbidity levels is due to the low burn on vegetation and the soil in the low burned gauges watershed. With less burn on the soil and vegetation infiltration is not as highly effected. With the possibility of the infiltration not being heavily effected during precipitation events the water is able to be better absorbed before reaching a stream system. Which then creates less runoff of sedimentation into the streams that then create lower turbidity levels. When a wildfire occurs it is seen in Figure 3.9 that primarily high burned areas will create detrimental and greater values of turbidity to the watershed effected. Overall it is seen that turbidity levels become worse the worse the land was burned. Another thing to consider is turbidity levels can remain at a high rate years after the fire occurred since it takes time for the land to heal.
