In more recent due to a variety of variables such as climate change and human disturbances these fires no longer a pure natural and healthy occurrence. Wildfires damage the land in a multitude of ways. One of the things these fires effect heavily is the watersheds. When a wildfire burns through the land high severity burned areas see the worst of the effect, but even the low burned areas are still negatively affected. By looking into discharge rate (in/day) and turbidity levels (FNU) we will be able to gain better knowledge of the effects the fire has on the land and the stream health as well. Discharge levels will help us better understand how the streamflow and the possible layout of the streams will be affected. While turbidity will help us better understand the effects on the water quality of the stream for humans and the animals dependent on the effected water sources. To understand the effects that a wildfire can have on a watershed this study investigated the East Troublesome Fire that occurred near Grandby, CO in October of 2020. This study will highlight the affects and the importance in understanding the factors that wildfires will have on watersheds. "],["introduction.html", "2 Introduction", " 2 Introduction When wildfires occur, it creates major damages through the entire land and ecosystem of the area. A large part of the ecosystem that is affected is the watershed of the area. When a wildfire burns through the area it creates long-term affects that can alter the streamflow and water quality of that watershed. These wildfires were once a common natural occurrence in most forest ecosystems that did not have a devastating effect on the land. But in more recent years things such as climate change, fuel load accumulation, extensive droughts, and an increase in human presence in forests has caused a devastating effect on the land when these wildfires burn. The concern that comes from these factors has put a heavier strain on the understanding on how the landscape changes and reacts to the wildfire. There is a need to understand the interaction between wildfire, and associated responses in vegetation cover, and hydrologic and geomorphic behavior. (Owens et al. 2013) When a wildfire burns it way through the land it often causes dramatic changes in forest vegetation structure and soil conditions, it also alters the watershed processes that control streamflow, soil erosion, nutrient export, and downstream water chemistry (Hohner et al. 2019). The effect of erosion, infiltration, runoff, and slope failure play a major role in how the land is re-molded. These changes can include the streamflow, landscape, and the soil of the land. When a forest is undisturbed its soils have relatively high infiltration rates that helps to control runoff effects. Wildfires can reduce infiltration by exposing mineral soil to rain drop impact and splash that can seal soil pores at the surface (Ice, Neary, and Adams, n.d.). The effect that comes from the wildfire then causes dramatic changes in both annual and peak streamflows. The wildfires remove features from the land that shows decreased infiltration rates and increased runoff rates. As seen with high-severity fires heat the mineral soil and consume all vegetative ground cover, leaving only ash at the soil surface (Kunze and Stednick 2006). With the features burned away from the land it decreases infiltration and increases runoff creating a negative effect to streamflow and water quality. Reduced infiltration then promotes overland flow, surface erosion, runoff, and sediment that contributes to debris and extreme channel impacts that affect streamflow. These effects from a wildfire creates a domino effect that starts with the forest ecosystem and begins to alter the land and watershed from the most obvious to the least observed occurrences. After the wildfire causes changes to the watersheds soil and hydrologic system it then leads to further effects on the land and water quality. Sediment load, flooding, runoff, and erosion create new factors to consider. These large erosion events, such as those caused by wildfire, are short-lived on geological time scales, but can dominate the long-term sediment yield response(Murphy, McCLESKEY, and Writer, n.d.). This is an important factor to consider because of the water quality of the watershed. The mineralization of organic matter, interruption of root uptake, and loss of shade can further impact water quality by increasing stream temperatures and nutrient concentrations (Ice, Neary, and Adams, n.d.). Most water quality issues that occur in each watershed is seen after the wildfire is out. The postfire effects that is seen on the water quality has to do with water surface composition and the drinking water treatment. Once down-stream the water quality effects is better seen at water treatment plants and what needs to be done now to purify the water that was affected by postfire conditions. Extreme postfire erosion can damage infrastructure, accumulate in reservoirs, and challenge coagulation, filtration, and solids handling processes (Hohner et al. 2019). With all these factors occurring it causes these water treatment facilities to adapt to these new quality features so that the people dependent on that water source can still use the water source. Changes in the quantity and composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) exported from burned watersheds can influence treatment process performance and the formation of disinfection byproducts (DBPs) (Hohner et al. 2019). This is important to understand to see the effects the wildfire has on the water quality. Here it is seen that even after the fire is out it does not mean the effects of the fire is gone. In the state of Colorado warmer spring air temperatures and longer wildfire seasons in the western US (Mast et al. 2016) had created the land for larger and longer wildfire season. This increase has created concern for larger fires to appear across Colorados Front Range. With the possibility of even larger fires to occur it creates instability in the land once the fire burn through it, which creates alterations to the watersheds associated with the fire. Postfire the largest change in the land is the increase in runoff and erosion. The effects that come from runoff and erosion has pushed for efforts to better understand wildfires in the Colorado Front Range and effects it has on the soil and water quality. An example of a wildfire that has affected a watershed was that of the East Troublesome Fire that occurred the afternoon of October 14, 2020. Fire behavior played a large role in the severity of impacts to soil in the East Troublesome fire (Forest 2020). The fire also altered the watershed of this area due to the location of this wildfire. The fire burned at a high elevation which is composed of a dominated snowmelt watershed attached to the Upper Colorado River. The watershed response within the burned area will likely include an initial flush of ash, rill, and gully erosion in headwater drainages and on steep slopes, areas with snowmelt peak flows elevated over 50% relative to pre-fire, sediment-laden flash floods following high-intensity rain events, and potentially debris flows (Forest 2020). This effect on the watershed can affect the soil, land, and water quality. The streamflow is also highly affected by such a fire due to the debris that fall into the streams. Debris flows are among the most hazardous consequences of rainfall on burned hillslopes (Forest 2020). These kinds of debris can affect the streamflow and effect the watershed overall. This study will be looking more into the East Troublesome Fire and the effects, it has had on the streamflow and water quality of the watershed. East Troublesome Fire in the Kawuneechee Valley.

As seen in the graph high burn severity has a high influence in increased turbidity, while low burn sites are not as greatly infulenced when comparing to the control site variable. "],["discussion.html", "5 Discussion", " 5 Discussion For the four sites I only used the Grand Lake site for turbidity data and not discharge due to the negative readings. Due to the location of the Grand Lake site the discharge levels at times were reading negatively which is not possible so I chose to not use the discharge data so that it does not affect my observation of the discharge data. The turbidity data was still reliable and that is why I only used that variable from this site when comparing values for my observations. That is why it is seen in Figure 3.8 there is only three sites and why in Figure 3.9 there is four sites. https://data.rgj.com/fires/incident/photograph/7267/0/111385/ Observing Figure 3.8 shows that as the increase in burn severity occurs the discharge levels decrease. The control site chosen is found southeast of the East Troublesome bottom fire perimeter in Grandby, CO and is about 20 miles away. The observed discharge in this location is found to have ranging values from 0.05 to 0.15 in/day with a mean value of about 0.09 in/day. Which is observed to be the highest discharge rates compared to all three sites. Then going to the Colorado River site that was in a low burn area the discharge was less than the control site, but greater than the high burn area. The range was from 0.002 to 0.14 in/day, with a mean of 0.07 in/day. Finally, the Troublesome Creek site which is the high burn site had the lowest of the discharge rate. Ranging from 0.0009 to 0.014 in/day with a mean of 0.065 in/day. Observing this data from Figure 3.8 presents a clear finding that the discharge rates in these specific watersheds are negatively affected by the wildfire. Contributing factors that can have an impact on the discharge to decrease it so rapidly is the disturbance to the riparian and upland vegetation condition. When the wildfire burned through the Troublesome Creek watershed it was in a high burn area due to the top of the watershed location. The fire as seen in the image above the part of the fire that the Troublesome Creek is attached to be a high burned soil area. The Higher burn severity then leads to believe that the riparian and upland vegetation was heavily disturbed and burned away. Reduction in riparian woody species cover increases the amount of solar radiation hitting the stream channel, increasing stream temperatures, and accelerating the loss of water in the stream channel to evaporation (Leonard et al. 2017). The high burn severity and possible loss of the riparian buffer at the head of the Troublesome Creek watershed explains why at the end of the watershed where the gauge is located has such a low discharge rate. Due to the gauge being at the end of the watershed it reads levels after the upstream water begins to evaporate due to the lack of vegetation. There is also the factor to take in that the loss of the organic soil layer which reduces the transfer of soil nutrients into the stream channel which can also alter the levels of base flow discharge in the burned streams. Overall high severity burns on the vegetation and soil in the watershed can cause negative impacts that causes a loss of water in a stream that then decreases discharge rates. Observing Figure 3.9 shows the rate of turbidity for all four sites from June to October in the year 2021, the year after the fire occurred. Turbidity in streams will be better seen after the fire is out during snow melt and heavy rainfall as well. Since the fire occurred in late fall of 2020 turbidity would not be seen as well until the spring and summer time the following year, which is what Figure 3.9 represents. As seen in the figure the high burn level from Troublesome Creek which is marked as purple produced high turbidity levels and many increased spikes through the wetter seasons for Colorado. The periods of no precipitation, including snow melt, shows the low turbidity concentration. Then when precipitation rates occur turbidity results increased to greater rates due to the area being burned. These high turbidity rate from the high burned area is explained by the lack of infiltration and increase of runoff due to the vegetation being burned away. Then focusing on the other three sites presents how low burn areas and a control site can relate to each other. As seen in Figure 3.9 where the control site is colored green , the turbidity is much lower than the high burn area while it is similar to the low burn area. It is seen that the low burn area does not have a strong effect on turbidity levels as seen by both low burn areas. Where low burn 1 has turbidity levels lower than the control site and low burn 2 had turbidity levels that is not varied far from the values of the control site. The reason the low burn areas may not present high turbidity levels is due to the low burn on vegetation and the soil in the low burned gauges watershed. With less burn on the soil and vegetation infiltration is not as highly effected. With the possibility of the infiltration not being heavily effected during precipitation events the water is able to be better absorbed before reaching a stream system. Which then creates less runoff of sedimentation into the streams that then create lower turbidity levels. When a wildfire occurs it is seen in Figure 3.9 that primarily high burned areas will create detrimental and greater values of turbidity to the watershed effected. Overall it is seen that turbidity levels become worse the worse the land was burned. Another thing to consider is turbidity levels can remain at a high rate years after the fire occurred since it takes time for the land to heal. "],["conclusion.html", "6 Conclusion", " 6 Conclusion After the East Troublesome fire occurred there were observed negative effects on the streamflow, land, and water quality. There was found to be increased turbidity levels at high burned areas. This increase in turbidity effects the water quality to both human and animals. Increased turbidity reduces recreational appeal, which decreases quality of life for residents and causes a lost income from tourist. It also increases cost in water quality treatments centers to clean the water to be used. Turbidity also decreased photosynthesis in the streams which then decreases levels of oxygen that then negatively affect fish, invertebrates, and vegetation population. With the decrease in discharge with the higher the burn severity it shows that the vegetation and land have been negatively affected by the fires high severity. With the land and soil being so negatively affected that it possibly eliminated the riparian area, soil radiation was then able to create higher evaporation. This then decreases streamflow and discharge rates. This creates a negative effect for humans dependent on this water source due to the possible decrease in water they can obtain for use from this water source. This also effects living organisms dependent of the water source by eliminated an ecosystem for aquatic life. Overall, it is seen wildfires do have a continuous negative effect on the watersheds even once the fire is out. If we can learn from past fires we can then better the lives of animals and people for years to come.
