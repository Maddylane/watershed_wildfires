	abstract = {Wildﬁres burn extensive forest areas around the world each year. In many locations, ﬁre-prone forest catchments are utilised for the supply of potable water to small communities up to large cities. Following wildﬁre, increased erosion rates and changes to runoff generation and pollutant sources may greatly increase ﬂuxes of sediment, nutrients and other water quality constituents, potentially contaminating water supplies. Most research to date has focused on suspended sediment exports and concentrations after wildﬁre. Reported ﬁrst year post-ﬁre suspended sediment exports varied from 0.017 to 50 t {haÀ}1 {yearÀ}1 across a large range of catchment sizes (0.021–1655 km2). This represented an estimated increase of 1–1459 times unburned exports. Maximum reported concentrations of total suspended solids in streams for the ﬁrst year after ﬁre ranged from 11 to \$500,000 mg {LÀ}1. Similarly, there was a large range in ﬁrst year post-ﬁre stream exports of total N (1.1–27 kg {haÀ}1 {yearÀ}1) and total P (0.03–3.2 kg {haÀ}1 {yearÀ}1), representing a multiple change of 0.3–431 times unburned, while {NOÀ}3 exports of 0.04–13.0 kg {haÀ}1 {yearÀ}1 (3–250 times unburned) have been reported. {NOÀ}3 , {NOÀ}2 , and {NH}3/{NHþ}4 concentrations in streams and lakes or reservoirs may increase after wildﬁre but appear to present a generally low risk of exceeding drinking water guidelines. Few studies have examined post-ﬁre exports of trace elements. The limited observations of trace element concentrations in streams after wildﬁre found high levels (well over guidelines) of Fe, Mn, As, Cr, Al, Ba, and Pb, which were associated with highly elevated sediment concentrations. In contrast, Cu, Zn, and Hg were below or only slightly above guideline values. Elevated Na+, {ClÀ} and {SO}24À solute yields have been recorded soon after ﬁre, while reports of concentrations of these constituents were mostly conﬁned to coniferous forest areas in North America, where maximum sampled values were well below recommended limits. Likewise, reported wildﬁre effects on dissolved organic carbon were generally minor and elevated concentrations largely reﬂected background conditions. Available cyanide concentrations in small streams may approach levels of concern soon after ﬁre, but increases are likely to be of short duration. Post-ﬁre concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in streams have been found to increase but remained within the recommended limit. Large increases in exports and concentrations of some constituents after wildﬁre indicate the potential for impacts on water supply from forest catchments. In response, various water treatment measures may be required and in the absence of adequate treatment facilities or alternative sources, water supplies may be vulnerable to disruption.},

The goal of this study was to characterize and compare the streamﬂow and suspended sediment yield response of two watersheds (Bobcat Gulch and Jug Gulch) after the 2000 Bobcat ﬁre. Bobcat Gulch had several erosion control treatments applied after the ﬁre, including aerial seeding, contour log felling, mulching, and straw wattles. Jug Gulch was partially seeded. Study objectives were to: (1) measure precipitation, streamﬂow, and sediment yields; (2) assess the effect of rainfall intensity on peak discharges, storm runoff, and sediment yields; (3) evaluate short-term hydrologic recovery.},

	abstract = {In August 2003 a severe wildﬁre burnt 62\% of Fishtrap Creek, a 158 km2 watershed in central British Columbia, Canada. Streamﬂows were obtained for the period 1980–2010 and suspended sediment ﬂuxes were determined for the period 2004–2010 for Fishtrap Creek and these were compared to data for nearby Jamieson Creek, which was not affected by the wildﬁre. Peak streamﬂows in Fishtrap Creek after the wildﬁre were not signiﬁcantly higher than before the wildﬁre, although total annual runoff had increased. Perhaps the most important change in streamﬂows following the wildﬁre was that peak ﬂows associated with the annual freshet occurred earlier in the year (by ca. 2 weeks). Following the wildﬁre, monthly total suspended sediment ﬂuxes peaked in April in Fishtrap Creek and May in Jamieson Creek, which reﬂects the change in timing of peak streamﬂows in Fishtrap. Speciﬁc suspended sediment yields were low in the ﬁrst year following the wildﬁre (2004), and peak values for the 2004–2010 monitoring period occurred in 2006. Average speciﬁc suspended sediment yields over the monitoring period were similar for both watersheds at 2.8 and 2.9 t km−2 year−1 for Fishtrap and Jamieson watersheds, respectively. The muted responses of streamﬂows and suspended sediment ﬂuxes following this severe wildﬁre are due to the lack of winter precipitation and the low intensities of summer rainfall events in the ﬁrst year following the wildﬁre. Greater winter precipitation and associated snowmelt in subsequent years coincided with vegetation recovery. The major changes in the wildﬁre-affected watershed were increased bank erosion and channel migration due to a loss of root strength and cohesion, which occurred 3–5 years after the ﬁre. This work demonstrates that the hydrological and geomorphological responses of watersheds to wildﬁres are a function of the severity of the wildﬁre and the timing and nature of driving forces (i.e. rainfall intensity, winter precipitation and snowmelt) during the progression of vegetation recovery.},

	abstract = {Wildfires occur frequently in the Colorado Front Range and can alter the hydrological response of watersheds, yet little information exists on the impact of flow regime and storm events on post-wildfire water quality. The flow regime in the region is characterized by base-flow conditions during much of the year and increased runoff during spring snowmelt and summer convective storms. The impact of snowmelt and storm events on stream discharge and water quality was evaluated for about a year after a wildfire near Boulder, Colorado, {USA}. During spring snowmelt and low-intensity storms, differences in discharge and turbidity at sites upstream and downstream from the burned areas were minimal. However, high-intensity convective storms resulted in dramatic increases in discharge and turbidity at sites downstream from the burned area. This study highlights the importance of using high-frequency sampling to assess accurately wildfire impacts on water quality downstream.},

	abstract = {Wildﬁres can greatly alter the vegetation, soils, and hydrologic processes of watersheds serving as drinking water supplies, which may negatively inﬂuence source water quality and treatment. To address wildﬁre impacts on treatment, a drinking water intake below a burned watershed and an upstream, unburned reference site were monitored following the High Park wildﬁre (2012) in the Cache la Poudre watershed of northern Colorado, {USA}. Turbidity, nutrients, dissolved organic matter ({DOM}) character, coagulation treatability, and disinfection byproduct formation were evaluated and compared to pre-ﬁre data. Post-ﬁre paired spatial differences between the treatment plant intake and reference site for turbidity, nitrogen, and phosphorus increased by an order of magnitude compared to pre-ﬁre differences. Fluorescence index ({FI}) values were signiﬁcantly higher at the intake compared to the reference site (D ¼ 0.04), and higher than pre-ﬁre years, suggesting the wildﬁre altered the {DOM} character of the river. Total trihalomethane ({TTHM}) and haloacetonitrile ({HAN}4) formation at the intake were 10.1 mg {LÀ}1 and 0.91 mg {LÀ}1 higher than the reference site. Post-ﬁre water was amenable to conventional treatment at a 10 mg {LÀ}1 higher average alum dose than reference samples. The intake was also monitored following rainstorms. Post-rainstorm samples showed the maximum observed {FI} values (1.52), {HAN}4 (3.4 mg {mgCÀ}1) and chloropicrin formation yields (3.6 mg {mgCÀ}1), whereas {TTHM} and haloacetic acid yields were not elevated. Several post-rainstorm samples presented treatment challenges, and even at high alum doses (65 mg {LÀ}1), showed minimal dissolved organic carbon removal ({\textless}10\%). The degraded water quality of the post-rainstorm samples is likely attributed to the combined effects of runoff from precipitation and greater erosion following wildﬁre. Wildﬁre impacts cannot be separated from rainfall effects due to the lack of post-rainstorm samples from the reference site. Results suggest for this study region, wildﬁre may have consequences for inﬂuent water quality, coagulant dosing, and {DBP} speciation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
